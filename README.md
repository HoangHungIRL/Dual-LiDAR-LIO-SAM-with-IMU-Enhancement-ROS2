# Dual-LiDAR-LIO-SAM-with-IMU-Enhancement-ROS2-
This project is an extended version of LIO-SAM implemented in ROS2, supporting dual LiDAR configuration and IMU enhancement. It introduces an improved IMU processing pipeline with a low-pass filter to suppress noise and a refined orientation estimation method for better odometry stability under dynamic or noisy conditions.
